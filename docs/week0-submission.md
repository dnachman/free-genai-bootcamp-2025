## Hypothesis and technical uncertainties

Evaluating the prompting approach across several AI powered assistants. It's my assumption that the paid assistants will provide better output than open source ones (such as ollama). I'm also curious to see how the paid and free tier assistants compare to each other.

## Technical exploration

I followed along with the meta-ai model that Andrew used in the video and worked through some of the prompts. Not sure all of them were relevant.

I also explored the Chatgpt model (Paid) and it was interesting to see the various outputs from a "normal" transformer (4o) and the reasoning transformer (o3-mini).

Lastly, I explored the Ollama model (Free) and it was interesting to see the output from that model as well.

I purposely asked for conjugation examples because that's something I remember having trouble with in Spanish class in High School (~ 30 years ago).

## Final Outcomes

## Anything else you'd like to add

Glad to be in another of your bootcamps! The submission example process video is really helpful. It would be great to have a concise "expectations" video/section at the beginning of each week to help guide the work, especially if we want to figure it out on our own.
