## 3. Grammar and Structure Clues

1. **Expressing Uncertainty**:

   - In Spanish, to say "I'm not sure," you generally use the structure **"no + estar + seguro(a)"**.
   - **Clue:** Place **no** before the verb and make sure the adjective agrees with your subject (if you are female, change **seguro** to **segura**).

2. **Forming Questions**:

   - Spanish questions start with an inverted question mark **(¬ø)** and end with a regular question mark **(?)**.
   - **Clue:** Think about how you can start the second clause as a direct question.

3. **Using Infinitives**:

   - Both **comer** and **recomendar** should be in their infinitive forms for parts of the sentence.
   - **Clue:** Since we are not using participles or gerunds, these actions are expressed simply as the infinitive.

4. **Connecting the Clauses**:

   - The sentence is divided by a comma in English. In Spanish, you can also use a comma to separate your statements or questions.
   - **Clue:** Consider whether you need a conjunction or if the comma alone will guide the reader through the two thoughts.

5. **Word Order and Placement**:
   - Spanish often follows a Subject-Verb-Object structure, but when forming questions, the order can change.
   - **Clue:** In the question part ("where do you recommend?"), think about placing **t√∫** (or the appropriate form) before the verb **recomiendas** or after, depending on whether you include the subject pronoun.

## 4. Conjugation Clues

- For **estar** (to be):

  - **yo estoy**
  - **t√∫ est√°s**
  - **√©l/ella est√°**

- For **comer** (to eat):

  - **yo como**
  - **t√∫ comes**
  - **√©l/ella come**

- For **recomendar** (to recommend):
  - **yo recomiendo**
  - **t√∫ recomiendas**
  - **√©l/ella recomienda**

**Clue:** When forming your sentence, consider whether to use the subject pronoun (like **yo** or **t√∫**) explicitly, or rely on the conjugated form to imply the subject.
