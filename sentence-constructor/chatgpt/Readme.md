## 3. Grammar and Structure Clues

1. **Expressing Uncertainty**:

   - In Spanish, to say "I'm not sure," you generally use the structure **"no + estar + seguro(a)"**.
   - **Clue:** Place **no** before the verb and make sure the adjective agrees with your subject (if you are female, change **seguro** to **segura**).

2. **Forming Questions**:

   - Spanish questions start with an inverted question mark **(¬ø)** and end with a regular question mark **(?)**.
   - **Clue:** Think about how you can start the second clause as a direct question.

3. **Using Infinitives**:

   - Both **comer** and **recomendar** should be in their infinitive forms for parts of the sentence.
   - **Clue:** Since we are not using participles or gerunds, these actions are expressed simply as the infinitive.

4. **Connecting the Clauses**:

   - The sentence is divided by a comma in English. In Spanish, you can also use a comma to separate your statements or questions.
   - **Clue:** Consider whether you need a conjunction or if the comma alone will guide the reader through the two thoughts.

5. **Word Order and Placement**:
   - Spanish often follows a Subject-Verb-Object structure, but when forming questions, the order can change.
   - **Clue:** In the question part ("where do you recommend?"), think about placing **t√∫** (or the appropriate form) before the verb **recomiendas** or after, depending on whether you include the subject pronoun.

---

## 4. Conjugation Clues

- For **estar** (to be):

  - **yo estoy**
  - **t√∫ est√°s**
  - **√©l/ella est√°**

- For **comer** (to eat):

  - **yo como**
  - **t√∫ comes**
  - **√©l/ella come**

- For **recomendar** (to recommend):
  - **yo recomiendo**
  - **t√∫ recomiendas**
  - **√©l/ella recomienda**

**Clue:** When forming your sentence, consider whether to use the subject pronoun (like **yo** or **t√∫**) explicitly, or rely on the conjugated form to imply the subject.

### Output

Great! Let‚Äôs break this sentence down and guide you through the translation. Since you‚Äôre starting, I‚Äôll provide a moderate level of guidance, but if you need more help, let me know!

1. Understanding the Sentence Structure

Your English sentence:
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure where to eat dinner, where do you recommend?‚Äù

This sentence has two key parts: 1. Expressing uncertainty ‚Üí ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure where to eat dinner‚Äù 2. Asking for a recommendation ‚Üí ‚ÄúWhere do you recommend?‚Äù

2. Vocabulary Table

English Spanish (dictionary form) Example Conjugation Notes
to be (temporary) estar yo estoy, t√∫ est√°s, √©l/ella est√°, nosotros estamos Use for temporary states like feelings
not no (placed before the verb) Used for negation
sure seguro (adjective; feminine: segura) Must agree with the subject in gender
where d√≥nde (used in questions) Needs an accent in questions
to eat comer yo como, t√∫ comes, √©l/ella come, nosotros comemos Use the infinitive form in this case
dinner la cena (noun, feminine) ‚ÄúDinner‚Äù always takes la as the article
to recommend recomendar yo recomiendo, t√∫ recomiendas, √©l/ella recomienda Stem-changing verb (e ‚Üí ie)
you (informal) t√∫ (subject pronoun) Drop it in casual speech, but keep for clarity

3. Grammar and Structure Clues

   1. Expressing Uncertainty
      ‚Ä¢ In Spanish, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure‚Äù is formed using ‚Äúno + estar + seguro/segura‚Äù.
      ‚Ä¢ Clue: Make sure ‚Äúseguro‚Äù agrees with the speaker‚Äôs gender (if female, use segura).
   2. Using ‚ÄúWhere‚Äù in Indirect Questions
      ‚Ä¢ In Spanish, ‚Äúwhere to eat dinner‚Äù follows a structure similar to English.
      ‚Ä¢ Clue: You‚Äôll still use d√≥nde, but you won‚Äôt need to change the word order much.
   3. Infinitives in Sentences
      ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúTo eat‚Äù should stay in its infinitive form (comer) because it follows ‚Äúwhere.‚Äù
      ‚Ä¢ Clue: No need to conjugate comer in this sentence!
   4. Forming Questions in Spanish
      ‚Ä¢ The second part of the sentence is a direct question (‚ÄúWhere do you recommend?‚Äù).
      ‚Ä¢ Clue: Spanish question structure follows: Question word + verb + subject (optional).
      ‚Ä¢ In this case, ‚Äúd√≥nde recomiendas t√∫?‚Äù follows that structure.

4. Conjugation Clues
   ‚Ä¢ Estar (to be):
   ‚Ä¢ yo estoy
   ‚Ä¢ t√∫ est√°s
   ‚Ä¢ √©l/ella est√°
   ‚Ä¢ Comer (to eat):
   ‚Ä¢ yo como
   ‚Ä¢ t√∫ comes
   ‚Ä¢ √©l/ella come
   ‚Ä¢ Recomendar (to recommend - stem-changing verb!):
   ‚Ä¢ yo recomiendo
   ‚Ä¢ t√∫ recomiendas
   ‚Ä¢ √©l/ella recomienda

5. Your Turn!

Try putting the sentence together using the clues above. Here‚Äôs a structure to follow: 1. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure where to eat dinner‚Äù ‚Üí No estoy seguro(a) d√≥nde comer la cena (Does this structure make sense to you?) 2. ‚ÄúWhere do you recommend?‚Äù ‚Üí ¬øD√≥nde recomiendas t√∫? (Can you see why ‚Äúrecomiendas‚Äù is used here?)

Give it a shot, and let me know if you need more hints! üòä
