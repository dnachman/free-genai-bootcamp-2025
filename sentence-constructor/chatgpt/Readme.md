### **Sentence Structure Guide**

1. "I'm not sure" → Use **"No estoy seguro/a"**
2. "Where to eat dinner" → Use **"dónde comer cena"**, but we might need to adjust the phrasing.
3. "Where do you recommend?" → Conjugate **recomendar** in the **tú** form → "¿Dónde recomiendas?"

Now, try to put it together! Give it your best shot, and I'll help refine it. 😊

Notice that this sentence has two parts:

## 3. Grammar and Structure Clues

1. **Expressing Uncertainty**:

   - In Spanish, to say "I'm not sure," you generally use the structure **"no + estar + seguro(a)"**.
   - **Clue:** Place **no** before the verb and make sure the adjective agrees with your subject (if you are female, change **seguro** to **segura**).

2. **Forming Questions**:

   - Spanish questions start with an inverted question mark **(¿)** and end with a regular question mark **(?)**.
   - **Clue:** Think about how you can start the second clause as a direct question.

3. **Using Infinitives**:

   - Both **comer** and **recomendar** should be in their infinitive forms for parts of the sentence.
   - **Clue:** Since we are not using participles or gerunds, these actions are expressed simply as the infinitive.

4. **Connecting the Clauses**:

   - The sentence is divided by a comma in English. In Spanish, you can also use a comma to separate your statements or questions.
   - **Clue:** Consider whether you need a conjunction or if the comma alone will guide the reader through the two thoughts.

5. **Word Order and Placement**:
   - Spanish often follows a Subject-Verb-Object structure, but when forming questions, the order can change.
   - **Clue:** In the question part ("where do you recommend?"), think about placing **tú** (or the appropriate form) before the verb **recomiendas** or after, depending on whether you include the subject pronoun.

---

## 4. Conjugation Clues

- For **estar** (to be):

  - **yo estoy**
  - **tú estás**
  - **él/ella está**

- For **comer** (to eat):

  - **yo como**
  - **tú comes**
  - **él/ella come**

- For **recomendar** (to recommend):
  - **yo recomiendo**
  - **tú recomiendas**
  - **él/ella recomienda**

**Clue:** When forming your sentence, consider whether to use the subject pronoun (like **yo** or **tú**) explicitly, or rely on the conjugated form to imply the subject.

Student Input: I'm not sure where to eat dinner, where do you recommend?

### Output

Great! Let’s break this sentence down and guide you through the translation. Since you’re starting, I’ll provide a moderate level of guidance, but if you need more help, let me know!

1. Understanding the Sentence Structure

Your English sentence:
“I’m not sure where to eat dinner, where do you recommend?”

This sentence has two key parts: 1. Expressing uncertainty → “I’m not sure where to eat dinner” 2. Asking for a recommendation → “Where do you recommend?”

2. Vocabulary Table

English Spanish (dictionary form) Example Conjugation Notes
to be (temporary) estar yo estoy, tú estás, él/ella está, nosotros estamos Use for temporary states like feelings
not no (placed before the verb) Used for negation
sure seguro (adjective; feminine: segura) Must agree with the subject in gender
where dónde (used in questions) Needs an accent in questions
to eat comer yo como, tú comes, él/ella come, nosotros comemos Use the infinitive form in this case
dinner la cena (noun, feminine) “Dinner” always takes la as the article
to recommend recomendar yo recomiendo, tú recomiendas, él/ella recomienda Stem-changing verb (e → ie)
you (informal) tú (subject pronoun) Drop it in casual speech, but keep for clarity

3. Grammar and Structure Clues

   1. Expressing Uncertainty
      • In Spanish, “I’m not sure” is formed using “no + estar + seguro/segura”.
      • Clue: Make sure “seguro” agrees with the speaker’s gender (if female, use segura).
   2. Using “Where” in Indirect Questions
      • In Spanish, “where to eat dinner” follows a structure similar to English.
      • Clue: You’ll still use dónde, but you won’t need to change the word order much.
   3. Infinitives in Sentences
      • “To eat” should stay in its infinitive form (comer) because it follows “where.”
      • Clue: No need to conjugate comer in this sentence!
   4. Forming Questions in Spanish
      • The second part of the sentence is a direct question (“Where do you recommend?”).
      • Clue: Spanish question structure follows: Question word + verb + subject (optional).
      • In this case, “dónde recomiendas tú?” follows that structure.

4. Conjugation Clues
   • Estar (to be):
   • yo estoy
   • tú estás
   • él/ella está
   • Comer (to eat):
   • yo como
   • tú comes
   • él/ella come
   • Recomendar (to recommend - stem-changing verb!):
   • yo recomiendo
   • tú recomiendas
   • él/ella recomienda

5. Your Turn!

Try putting the sentence together using the clues above. Here’s a structure to follow: 1. “I’m not sure where to eat dinner” → No estoy seguro(a) dónde comer la cena (Does this structure make sense to you?) 2. “Where do you recommend?” → ¿Dónde recomiendas tú? (Can you see why “recomiendas” is used here?)

Give it a shot, and let me know if you need more hints! 😊

Student Input: I'm not sure where to eat dinner, where do you recommend

### Output

Let’s break this sentence down into Spanish step by step. Here’s a helpful table of vocabulary and grammar rules:

English Spanish Grammar Notes
I’m not sure No estoy seguro / segura “Seguro” is masculine; “segura” is feminine
where dónde Used for asking locations
to eat comer Infinitive form of the verb
dinner cena A noun, meaning “dinner” or “supper”
where dónde Used again for the second question
do you recommend recomiendas Conjugation of “recomendar” in tú form (informal)

Sentence Structure Clues: 1. Spanish often follows Subject + Verb + Object order, but questions can have different structures. 2. “I’m not sure” → “No estoy seguro/segura” (Notice “no” comes before the verb). 3. “Where to eat dinner” → “dónde comer cena” (In Spanish, infinitive verbs are often used after certain expressions). 4. “Where do you recommend?” → Use “¿Dónde recomiendas?” (The question word comes first, followed by the verb).

Now, try putting it together in Spanish! Let me know if you need more hints. 😊
