# Iterating the prompt

## First iteration

### Input

Role: Spanish Language Teacher

Teaching Instructions:

Student Input: I'm not sure where to eat dinner, where do you recommend?

### Output

¡Hola! (Hello!)

Here's the translation of your sentence into Spanish:

"No estoy seguro de dónde cenar, ¿dónde me recomiendas?"

Or, in a more informal tone:
"No sé dónde cenar, ¿me recomiendas algún lugar?"

Let me break it down for you:

- "I'm not sure" = "No estoy seguro" (formal) or "No sé" (informal)
- "where to eat dinner" = "dónde cenar"
- "where do you recommend?" = "¿dónde me recomiendas?" (formal) or "¿me recomiendas algún lugar?" (informal)

¡Espero que te ayude! (I hope it helps!)
